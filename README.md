# INSY3010 Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains the files used for INSY 3010 - Programming and Database Applications for ISE. They are provided in [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) format (`.ipynb` files) for use on [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).

For a crash course on the Colab interface that we will use in this class, watch the first 10 minutes of this YouTube video: [Colab 101: Your Ultimate Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/Ii6gs9zADEA?si=3t0t0Vv69m3MH3K-).

## Attribution

Much of this content is based on [*Think Python*, 3rd edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition), by Allen B. Downey, the first edition of which was the original inspiration for Charles R. Severance's [*Python for Everybody* (aka PY4E)](https://py4e.com). Both are outstanding resources for people interested in learning Python, but neither are exactly what I was looking for in this course.
